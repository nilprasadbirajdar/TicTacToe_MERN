# TicTacToe_MERN
 
This project was initialized using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
 
## Available Scripts
 
In the project directory, you can utilize the following scripts:
 
### `npm start`
 
Launches the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.
 
The page will automatically reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.
 
### `npm test`
 
Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode. Refer to the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
 
### `npm run build`
 
Builds the application for production in the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for optimal performance.
 
The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes. Your application is now ready for deployment!
 
Refer to the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information on deploying your app.
 
### `npm run eject`
 
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**
 
If you find the need to customize build tools and configurations, you can use `eject`. This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control. Note that all commands except `eject` will still work, but they will now point to the copied scripts.
 
You don't have to use `eject`. The provided feature set is suitable for small to mid-sized deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature unless you're ready for extensive customization.
